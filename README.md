## How to start this app
Put all the files into a directory, install the packages over the shell/cmd with the **'npm i'** command and afterwards start the app with the **'npm start'** command

## Notes
- I have chosen to realize this app with the "Create React App" starter kit.
- All the relevant code is located in those files:
    - src/components/commandLine.jsx
    - src/components/page.jsx
    - src/components/robot.jsx
    - src/constants/facing.ts

The rest of the code was mostly kept intact with minor changes in App.js and App.css.
